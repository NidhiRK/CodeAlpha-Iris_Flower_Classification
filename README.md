# 🌿 Iris Flower Classification - Machine Learning Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on classifying **Iris flower species** (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using **machine learning models**. The dataset includes measurements of **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**, which help in differentiating species.  

## 📌 Objective  
🔹 Train and evaluate multiple classification models to **predict the species** of an Iris flower based on its measurements.  
🔹 Compare model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and decision boundary visualizations.
